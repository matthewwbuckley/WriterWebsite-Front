## Writer Website for Short Stories
### Front
=====

This is the front end of a Short Story Site. [A live demo can be seen here.](https://ww-front.herokuapp.com/)

**Please note that both are hosted using the Free plan on Heroku, which means that both projects will require time to become active.**

If you would like to host the demo yourself you can clone or download the project. Then can be hosted locally using the npm command:

`npm start`

It will be connected to the hosted backend, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/matthewwbuckley/WriterWebsite-API). If you would like to host the backend yourself with a different database you will need to follow instructions on that project. The base api URL for the hosted backend is located at /scr/apiActions/index.js which should be changed if you host the backend locally or using another service.
